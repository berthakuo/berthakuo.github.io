This is my 2019 UX Portfolio

After checking out this repo, you should run the following commands:

* npm install
Downloads all the packages listed in package.json. Do this when you check out a new copy of your repo.

* gulp watch
Use it to compile SASS into CSS. Was unsuccessful in getting browser sync to work so in addition to running gulp watch, you need to reload the browser to see any styling changes.
